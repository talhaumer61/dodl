You’ll use real-world tools and environments such as TensorFlow and Amazon Cloud, and you’ll have ongoing access to Penn Engineering faculty and TAs through live office hours and discussion forums.</p>
																																				<p>The MCIT Online degree program requires the completion of 10 fully online computer science courses made up of six core courses and four electives. There are no required real-time sessions.</p>
																																				<h6>6 Core Courses</h6>
																																				<ul>
																																					<li><p><strong>Introduction to Software Development (CIT 591)</strong>This course is an introduction to fundamental concepts of programming and computer science for students who have little or no experience in these areas.  Includes an introduction to programming using Python, where students are introduced to core programming concepts like data structures, conditionals, loops, variables, and functions.  Also provides an introduction to basic data science techniques using Python.  The second half of this course is an introduction to object-oriented programming using Java, where students are introduced to polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, and advanced data structures.  Students will also learn how to read and write to files, connect to databases, and use regular expressions to parse text.  This course includes substantial programming assignments in both Python and Java, and teaches techniques for test-driven development and debugging code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science (CIT 592)</strong>This course introduces students to math concepts that form the backbone of the majority of computer science. Topics covered include sets, functions, permutations and combinations, discrete probability, expectation, mathematical induction, and graph theory. The course goal of  is to ensure  students are comfortable  with the math required for most CIS electives.</p></li><li><p><strong>Introduction to Computer Systems (CIT 593)</strong>This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts of computer systems and computer architecture. Students learn C programming language and an instruction set (machine language) as basis for understanding how computers represent data, process information, and execute programs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Structures &amp; Software Design (CIT 594)</strong>This course focuses on data structures, software design, and advanced Java;   starting with an introduction to data structures and basics of  algorithm analysis. Important data structures covered include arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash maps, and graphs. The course also focuses on software design and advanced Java topics such as software architectures, design patterns, and concurrency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computer Systems Programming (CIT 595)</strong>This course is a continuation of CIT 593 and introduces students to fundamental concepts in computing systems. Divided into two parts, the first half of the course introduces important concepts in modern operating systems: processes, scheduling, caching, and virtual memory. The second half of the course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in the design and implementation of networked systems, their protocols, and applications. The course will use the C program language, and will develop your knowledge on C system calls, and libraries for process/thread creation and manipulation, synchronization, and network communication.</p></li><li><strong>Algorithms &amp; Computation (CIT 596)</strong>This course focuses primarily on the design and analysis of algorithms. It begins with sorting and searching algorithms, then investigates graph algorithms.  General algorithm design patterns like dynamic programming and greedy algorithms are then introduced. A section of this course is also devoted to understanding NP-Completeness.</li>

																																		<h6>477,616 recent views</h6>
																																		<p>This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.</p>

																													   						<h6>Take Courses</h6>
																																		   	<p>A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you\'d like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>
																																			<br>
																																			<h6>Hands-on Project</h6>
																																			<p>Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You\'ll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you\'ll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>
																																			<br>
																																			<h6>Earn a Certificate</h6>
																																			<p>When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you\'ll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.</p>

Don\'t worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.</p>

																																		<p>Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.</p>
																																		<p>In this course, we will learn the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. We will start from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. We will then advance to learning how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. You’ll be able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, you will be able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.</p>

																																			<h6>Take Courses</h6>
																																			<p>A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you\'d like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Hands-on Project</h6>
																																		 <p>Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You\'ll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you\'ll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Earn a Certificate</h6>
																																		 <p>When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you\'ll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.</p>

																																					 <p>In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book. Don\'t worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.</p>

																																			<h6>Take Courses</h6>
																																			<p>A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you\'d like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Hands-on Project</h6>
																																		 <p>Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You\'ll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you\'ll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Earn a Certificate</h6>
																																		 <p>When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you\'ll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.</p>

																																					 <p>In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book. Don\'t worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.</p>

																																		<p>Explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular without installing anything!</p>
																																		<p>This course is designed for intermediate learners who already have a solid foundation of basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, a broad overview of these topics will also be provided for beginning learners. The modules in this course cover web development basics, introduction to Angular, and developing an Angular application. At the end of the course, learners will fully develop a todo application using HTML, CSS, and Angular.</p>
																																		<p>To allow for a truly hands-on, self-paced learning experience, this course is video-free. Assignments contain short explanations with images and suggested exploration examples, building a deeper understanding by doing. You\'ll benefit from instant feedback from a variety of assessment items along the way, gently progressing from quick understanding checks (multiple choice, fill in the blank, and un-scrambling answer blocks) to small, approachable exercises that take minutes instead of hours.</p>

																													,'how-it-works'	=>	'<h5 class="subs-title text-center">How the Specialization Works</h5>
																																			<h6>Take Courses</h6>
																																			<p>A Coursera Specialization is a series of courses that helps you master a skill. To begin, enroll in the Specialization directly, or review its courses and choose the one you\'d like to start with. When you subscribe to a course that is part of a Specialization, you’re automatically subscribed to the full Specialization. It’s okay to complete just one course — you can pause your learning or end your subscription at any time. Visit your learner dashboard to track your course enrollments and your progress.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Hands-on Project</h6>
																																		 <p>Every Specialization includes a hands-on project. You\'ll need to successfully finish the project(s) to complete the Specialization and earn your certificate. If the Specialization includes a separate course for the hands-on project, you\'ll need to finish each of the other courses before you can start it.</p>
																																		 <br>
																																		 <h6>Earn a Certificate</h6>
																																		 <p>When you finish every course and complete the hands-on project, you\'ll earn a Certificate that you can share with prospective employers and your professional network.</p>
